# example-webui
An example Web Page hosted on Distributed Press with basic HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JS to test out WACZ Embeds, C2PA Four corners embeds, and Distributed Press publishing.

**See this in production at [https://distpress.walkerweb.me/](https://distpress.walkerweb.me/)**

To test out Locally
1. Clone the repo
2. Switch into the root directory and run `npm install`
3. Serve the site with [http-server](https://github.com/http-party/http-server).

**Option 1**- Run the site with npx using the command `npx http-server` once the server is running, you should be able to find the site by typing `localhost:8080` 

**Option 2**- install http-server locally using `npm install http-server`. Now http-server is installed globally, and you can serve the website from the root directory by running `http-server` once the server is running, you should be able to find the site by typing `localhost:8080`
